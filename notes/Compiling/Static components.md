# Static components

## Fields, initialisers, and nested classes

## Referencing fields and nested classes

It's possible to reference the current or nested classes in an initialiser or field's default value.

Therefore, the current class and previous fields must be already available.

This also means that static components must be ordered and executed accoring to declaration position.
