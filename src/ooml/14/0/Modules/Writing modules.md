A module is a collection of common code designed to be organised together as a single unit. Whereas [classes](#Declaring classes) contain the actual logic, modules make organising, finding, bundling, and sharing them easier.

Modules are [namespaces](#Declaring namespaces), so can contain more namespaces as well as classes.
